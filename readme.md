*Understanding “this” in javascript: 
*The this keyword refers to the context where a piece of code, such as a function's body, is supposed to run. Most typically, it is used in object methods, where this refers to the object that the method is attached to, thus allowing the same method to be reused on different objects.
*What is a .json file? Why is it used?
- JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format that stores and exchanges data in a way that's both human-readable and machine-parsable. The file most be fetched from a local or remote server in order to function. In this project ti realized that i didnt need to have a json file if i use an array in my javascript.
